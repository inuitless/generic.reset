# Reset

The inuitcss `reset` module is a considered approach to resetting elements. It
selectively removes margins and paddings from certain elements, and provides
some sensible defaults for some others.

Install using Bower:

    $ bower install --save inuitless-reset

This is the LESS port of [the inuit.css project](http://inuitcss.com), from [@csswizardry](https://twitter.com/csswizardry).
